            <h3> Origins </h3>
            <p>
                <b>O</b>nce upon a time there lived four great Sages, they who were the Firstborn of the Divine Goddess. 
                From them came the knowledge to create, to build, to nurture life as the Divine wished. 
                In time, the people raised and born from the Sages erected cities in honor of the ones that taught them everything they knew, and to ultimately pay respects to the Divine. 
                With the growth of mankind came paradise, and with paradise came the Hemeot, the antithesis to the Divine otherwise known as the All-Consuming. 
                Drawn to the shining beacon that was the new world, the Hemeot plagued mankind, instilling sin, despair, and ruin to snuff the light from all living things, to drown it within the quagmire of the Qliphoth below the lands.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>A</b>s a final act of their love for mankind, the Sages merged together to become the Sacred Tree, which banished and bound the Hemeot into its very core with the Sages' life energies acting as the seals upon it. 
                Rooted within the Qliphoth to stave off its spread, the Sacred Tree lifted the lands upon its myriad branches, saving mankind from what was inevitable demise.
                The Divine Goddess, mourning her Firstborn, descended to join with the Sacred Tree upon its boughs, her tears creating vast new oceans, breath becoming the wind, body bringing forth mountains and peaks all across the land.
                Thus was the world of Elisium established, with decades having passed and the four nations founded under the name of the Four Sages.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Y</b>et, the vestiges of Hemeot still lingered, finding their way into the hearts of men and women alike, eliciting slow and steady corruption from the inside out.
                Eventually, the All-Consuming's influence grew unchecked, and thus did the tale of the Chosen Heroes come to fruition...

                <b>V</b>anthia, named after one of the Great Sages, is a monarchy ruled traditionally by a chosen Queen who's bloodline descends from The Great Sage themselves.
                As the biggest of the four capitals of their respective nations, Vanthia is a center for commerce and merchantry, with ships coming by both air and sea a common sight there.
                With such a large populace comes an even larger military presence, the Royal Knights of Vanthia upholding discipline and values among their ranks to be known as one of the more stricter martial bodies among the four nations.
            </p>

            <p><b>A</b>mong the ranks of the Royal Knights is the upper echelon of the most strongest, the ones who have proven themselves time and time again through achievements in and out of conflict.
                Those with this privilege are referred to at Atlas Knights, the 'Guiding Stars' of Vanthia that pave the way to a brighter future.
                Of recent times, The Atlus Knights have become more of a feared elite few, their feats of strength and prowess in tumultuous times often spoken of all across Elisium.

                <h2> recounting the tale </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>D</b>uring the Era of Strife, the Four Nations of Elisium vyed for resources and power, the need to pursue their goals fueled by both noble and malicious intents. <br>
                    The Monarchy of Vanthia, the Nation of Azure Seas, boasted strong trade routes and military might, limited by their lack of physical territory. <br>
                    The Republic of Reveria, the Nation of Scarlet Valleys, founded by both the merchants and working-class citizens, saw profit in commercialization and productivity bolstered by rapid population growth. <br>
                    The Theocracy of Grandia, the Nation of Ivory Skies, spurred by religious dedication and righteous purpose, remains central as the source of the original scriptures of the Divine and her Four Sages. <br>
                    The Oligarchy of Evalia, the Nation of Golden Mountains, a paradise of nobles and the wealthy that built their reputation on the backs of the indentured, finds themselves expanding beyond their borders to satisfy their insatiable avarice. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>E</b>phrym Verdachiel, a boy who'd been born in the major city of Vanthia, aspired to join the ranks of the Royal Knights to become someone of notable worth and fame in order to help his family.
                    Throughout his boyhood he is met with friends, encountering a fated individual who would later become the love of his life, and resisted by adversaries barring his path.
                    Rising through the ranks of the Royal Knights, the boy becomes a man, and for his efforts becomes an Atlas Knight, one of few in Vanthia capable of such a title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>S</b>oon after, trouble brews beyond the horizon, with Evalia joining with Grandia to bring about the "Holy Purge" after their the former's expansion efforts thwarted multiple times by both Vanthia and Reveria.
                    Large-scale warfare spills the blood of many upon the lands of Elisium, that is until the emergence of the Thralls encroaches upon them all.
                    Brought forth by the scent of despair and carnage, the All-Consuming are relentless, taking the form of monsters that now roam the lands aimlessly.
                    During one particular operation, Ephrym and his allies make unlikely acquaintances from the opposing forces of Grandia and Evalia, joining together in their near-death experiences to repel overwhelming swarms of Thralls.
                    It is then they are spoken to, not by their commanding officers or their leaders, but by the Divine herself, chosen for their strengths and honest hearts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>A</b>s they soon discover, the Sacred Tree which had been the mythical bastion against darkness, was now corrupted from the inside out; Hemeot's influence and slowly welling strength threatened to break the Four Sages' Seals, their hold just barely able to contain the All-Conuming from being brought forth in its entirety once more.
                    It is then they are branded as traitors to their respective nations, seen collaborating with their "adversaries" and pursued for their supposed crimes against their people.
                    With no choice but to find the truth of the matter, the party led by Ephrym goes on to battle through arduous trials and fiendish opposition, their bond togther growing as the years go by.
                    Close bonds and friendships form, their stories known to one another, and their experiences ultimately creating the ties that would bind them together when their mettle was tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>I</b>t was during this time Ephrym found love, in the form of one of their group members hailing from Grandia. A pious woman, who stood firm as the healing presence among their ragtag band.
                    Even through the tribulations of being accused as a blasphemer, the woman held to her faith, leaning on her Knight when she found herself faltering at any point.
                    Through the adherence of her beliefs, the woman was to soon find herself becoming a vessel for the Divine, wholly accepting the duty of becoming living reincarnation of the Goddess herself.
                    For that, Ephrym was to realize later on, that despite having the Goddess herself in their midst, it would spell an unenviable fate for the love of his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>A</b>t the peak of their journey, nearing the climax of their efforts, Ephrym and his group discover that to expel and defeat Hemeot would mean undoing the Seals of the Four Sages, as binding it is no longer an option.
                    To that end, they prepare themselves for a final showdown, eventually earning the aid of the four nations in turn once the greater evil is made known.
                    It is then they learn of the harsh truths, that in order to defeat an All-Consuming Darkness they need to bring about an All-Encompassing Light, to summon the Divine herself from her mortal vessel and bring an end to the primordial plague of every living being.
                    Knowing the summoning would ultimately claim her life, the healer of Grnadia comes to terms with her mortality, her final words to everyone ringing loud and clear.
                    Ephrym however tries to find another way, another possibility, in order to save the one he cherishes so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>I</b>n the end, at the climax of their journey, the group succeeds to undoing the Seals of the Four Sages, leading to the final clash that involved all four nations converging upon Hemeot.
                    Once subdued, the Divine Goddess is summoned forth from her vessel, and in turn uses every ounce of her being to slay Hemeot once and for all.
                    The result causes her chosen mortal, the Healer of Grandia, to succumb to the strain of their journey taking its toll upon her being.
                    That day, Ephrym was to say goodbye to his significant other, a teary farewell that ended with the promise of him living out his life for the both of them.
                    At journey's end did the group disband, not wanting to rest upon their laurels but rather to go back to their normal lives, their everyday comforts.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>H</b>aving been banished originally from the Atlas Knights, Ephrym found himself without a home to return to, and instead looks to deal with his grief in the aftermath of his grand quest.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h2> the story so far </h2>
                    <b>T</b>wo years have passed since journey's end, with Ephrym finding work with the Cartographer's Guild, a neutral faction of adventurers and explorers looking to map the realm and its far reaches.
                    Taking on the occupation, the former Knight travels about, satisfying wanderlust during more peaceful times, the four nations now having agreed to a treaty to end the struggle amongst themselves.
                    Ever still does his melancholy sit heavy upon his shoulders, however slowly but surely he becomes better with every passing day, learning to live with his grief while finding a way to better go about his new life.

                    Empowered swings slice through the air, creating shockwaves that detonate on impact.
                    As with Recoil Release, the intensity scales with the current energy stores, but will also affect the range and speed of the shockwave as well.

            <i>o1.</i> DM/Main Approachable. Get to the point though, please. <br>
            <i>o2.</i> Treat RPC like Vegas. <br>
            <i>03.</i> Be a cool person and we'll vibe. I'm talkative. <br>
            <i>o4.</i> Golden rules apply at all times. <br>
            <i>o5.</i> Outside contact probably ain't for you. <br>
            <i>06.</i> I made the code, yes. No commissions. <br>
            <br>
            <h2> Roleplaying Standards </h2>
            <i>o1.</i> Long term stuff takes priority. Short is for one-off interactions. <br>
            <i>o2.</i> Shitposty to novella possible, appreciated even. <br>
            <i>o3.</i> Events in the 'Party' tab will affect Ephrym's story. All else is non-canon. <br>
            <i>o4.</i> Medieval-ish fantasy-oriented character. <br>
            <i>o5.</i> Story comes first. Smut is <a class="tooltip">reserved*.<span><center><br><br>Should certain interactions lead towards intimacy, that's fine. However if he's spoken for, smut is reserved solely for them.</center></span></a> <br>
            <i>06.</i> Combat is great. Not going to duel you though most likely. <br>
            <i>o7.</i> RPing as Ephrym's former party members is a BIG MAYBE. Ask. <br>
            <i>o8.</i> Expect <a class="tooltip">darker themes* <span><center><br><br>Ephrym is my take on a hero dealing with the aftermath of a world-saving grand quest. He deals with the loss of loved ones, the unceremonious peace that follows, and the depression/grief involved in such. He isn't mentally unstable, but trauma and sadness have a tendency to crop up in inopportune moments.</center></span> to be involved when writing with this character. <br>
